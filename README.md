## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How accurate are the chemical calculations?**
A: All rates are based on manufacturer specifications and professional lawn care standards. Rates include proper dilution ratios and application methods.

**Q: Can I use kitchen measurements instead of ounces?**
A: Yes! The calculator provides cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons for easy measuring. For example, 1 oz = 2 tbsp = 6 tsp.

**Q: What if my equipment isn't in the brand list?**
A: The brand field is now a text input - you can enter any brand name (John Deere, Craftsman, etc.).

**Q: Do I need to restart Home Assistant after adding equipment?**
A: Yes, after the initial setup to enable dynamic dropdowns. The config flow will remind you.

**Q: Can I track multiple lawn areas?**
A: Yes! Each integration instance tracks one lawn area with complete data isolation. Add multiple instances for different areas (front yard, back yard, etc.). Chemical applications in one zone won't appear in other zones.

**Q: What if I don't know my grass type?**
A: The integration defaults to Bermuda grass. You can change it later in the configuration.

**Q: How do I get the mixing instructions?**
A: Use the `calculate_application_rate` service with your chemical, equipment, and zone. You'll get professional mixing instructions with kitchen measurements.

**Q: How does equipment work with multiple zones?**
A: Equipment is shared across ALL zones for convenience - you don't need to add equipment for each zone. However, chemical applications are tracked separately per zone, so T-Nex applied in the Front Yard won't show up in Back Yard sensors.

**Q: Why are my chemical calculations showing zeros?**
A: The integration now automatically detects liquid vs granular applications. Make sure you're using the right equipment type (Sprayer for liquids, Spreader for granular) and the chemical supports that application method.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Equipment Not Showing**: Reload integration after adding equipment
- **Equipment Defaults to "None"**: This has been fixed - equipment now defaults to your actual equipment
- **Chemical Applications Cross-Contaminating Zones**: This has been fixed - each zone now has completely separate data storage
- **T-Nex/Disease Preventer Showing Zero Amounts**: This has been fixed - liquid chemicals now calculate properly
- **Calculate Rates Not Working**: Ensure you've selected equipment from dropdown
- **Kitchen Measurements Missing**: Check that chemical has liquid rates defined
- **Services Not Updating**: Restart Home Assistant after initial setup
- **Integration Icon Not Showing**: Restart Home Assistant after installation

### Logs
Check Home Assistant logs for:
- `custom_components.lawn_manager` - Integration logs
- Equipment update signals and service responses
